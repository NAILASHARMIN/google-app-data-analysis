# Google Play Store App Data Analysis
This is a data analysis and visualization project covering a real-world dataset of the Google Play store, one of the most used applications for downloading Android apps.

This project aims for cleaning the dataset, analyze it and extract insights, and finally visualizing it from a business stakeholder perspective.

My approch to the project can be divided into below parts:

1. I cleaned and processed the two datasets using Python (this included handling the missing values, fixing the date column etc)
2. Handling the special characters and preparing the dataset for MySQL Workbench Microsoft Excel (this included using VBA coding and macro)
3. Analyzing clean data with MySQL & finally 
4. Visualizing the findings with Tableau where i used the forecasting and trendline modeling to put more focus on the revenue aspect.
